# Dan Vu

Welcome to my page! On this website I have a combination of blogs, projects, and introductory information about me that I want to showcase.

I'm an electrical engineering student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. One goal of mine is to use my background in software and electrical engineering to help me make an impact on my community. From setting up a local Maui company's web presence, to developing analysis tools for the Skyline rail project, I hope that I can make an even bigger impact on my community by finding opportunities that help further my development.
