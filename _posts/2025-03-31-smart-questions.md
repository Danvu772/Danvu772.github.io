## Is it really that deep?
Every person who has ever touched any line of code will have come across a problem that they have to look up online. Most of the time, especially when starting out, questions that we come across are already asked and sometimes are extremely commonplace. These questions are often found on popular programming forums, the most notable one being Stack Overflow.

We all will have noob questions in our journeys, but the problem isn't in the experience level of a person asking a question, it's in the value of the question itself. This lower limit is often defined by the culture of the people who participate in answering these questions that us noobs often ask. Good questions on Stack Overflow demonstrate research, diligence, and thoughtfulness. These are traits I have unfortunately not shown in questions I have asked in the past. In fact, I have an old question that I asked when I was about 14 years old. Upon revisiting that, I'll actually make some changes to the question itself.

The huge point is, there's good questions and bad questions. Here's some examples of good and bad questions being asked on Stack Overflow.

## Bad Question

The [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77884594/80-bits-convert-bigdecimal) is so short that I could even quote it in this blog directly:

><b>80-bits convert Bigdecimal</b> <br><br>
>How to convert the 80 bit extended precision stream of IEEE754 specification into Bigdecimal <br><br> I have reviewed a large amount of data, but my ability is limited and there is no good solution, so I have no way to start,please help me,

To start, the question is extremely short, since the OP asks a very straightforward question. This is definitely a question that the OP could find out himself if he looked into the question deeper (just google it). In addition to that, OP does not provide any information about what he has done to try to figure out the question. He "reviewed a large amount of data", but it is extremely unclear what he has reviewed. To add icing on the cake, "please help me" is very sloppily appended to the end of the question, and it provides to value to it whatsoever. This is a textbook example of a bad question, especially after reading Eric Raymond's essay ["How to ask questions the smart way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).

## Good Question
[This well upvoted question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77819873/what-is-the-correct-output-of-sizeofstring) is an example of a good question.

This author is extremely detailed in all of the tools and software he used to get to this problem. In short, the author describes a disrepancy of the `sizeof("string")` function between two compilers. The author describes his exact microcontroller project, and also provides minimal, reproducible code. It turned out that through an answerer's investigation of the problem, they found out that there may be a bug in one of the compilers.

In short, this is a great question to have asked, since it actually adds a great deal of value to the microcontroller project, and may even push for improvements in the compiler itself. This question was a thoughtful and diligent question, and really exemplifies the art of question asking.

## Conclusion
All in all, it's really important to see great examples of both bad questions and good questions. This very assignment actually pushed me to edit one of my previous questions on Stack Overflow. Using these examples, I at least tried my best to strive towards contributing to the collective programming knowledge by asking good questions.
