Hi!
<br>
<br>
I'm an electrical engineering student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. One goal of mine is to use my background in
software and electrical engineering to help me make an impact on my community. From setting up a local Maui company's
web presence, to developing analysis tools for the Skyline rail project, I hope that I can make an even bigger impact on
my community by finding opportunities that help further my development.
<br>
<br>
Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a passion for technology and creating useful tools to make my life more fun.
Check out my portfolio to see some of my personal projects!
